# DMS Plugin, Sleep Inhibitor

This plugin polls DMS media devices and will disable sleep if one is found. This provides similar functionality to Caffeine GNOME extension, without having to manually click the button. I made it for a minimal operating system I am creating based on Universal Blue images, the operating system utilizes MangoWC (a tiling/scrolling compsitor for wayland) and DankMaterialShell to provide a complete desktop environment. Matugen is used to apply colorscheme to DMS and other apps such as VSCODE, Discord, Obsidian, Neovim, Kitty and colors used by MangoWC.

## How to use
1) Clone this repository in ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
2) Restart DMS Shell
3) Enable the plugin in settings
